1. as a user I go to the website and I choose a character from a list and a map. then I click a button to get a unique link I can send to a friend to challenge someone to the fight.
2. as the second user, I received the link, then I choose my character and click "accept challenge"
3. The game generates a image of the fight. It also generates stats for each character with instructor.
4. The faster user goes first. They can choose between four attacks pokemon style.
5. once they choose an attack, the game engine decides the outcome (does the attack hit or miss, does it do damage, does it do a critical hit, etc.) and generates an image of what happens.
6. then it's the next players turn and they can choose an attack.
7. rinse repeat until one of the characters is defeated.

generate cells for each turn in the battle. start with initial then move through

then update ui to be combo of pokemon and street fighter. cool hip 8bit style
