## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn install`         | Installs dependencies                            |
| `yarn dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `yarn build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `yarn preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `yarn astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `yarn astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

These do seem better! but the model might not be good enough

The bear is in front of the lion, its claws extended forward, just making contact with the lion's side. The lion is leaning slightly to the side, with its eyes squinting and mouth open in a grimace of pain. The lion's legs are slightly bent as it begins to stagger back. The bear is steady, maintaining its stance after the attack, with its back paws firmly on the ground, while the lion is pushed back due to the impact. Blood is lightly visible from the lion's side where the claws made contact.

The lion's mouth is clamped around the bear's shoulder, showing the fierce bite in action. The bear is leaning backward, with its eyes wide and mouth slightly open in response to the attack. The bear's front paws are slightly raised, and its body is pushed back to emphasize the impact of the bite. The lion is positioned slightly above the bear and facing it directly, showcasing dominance during the attack.
